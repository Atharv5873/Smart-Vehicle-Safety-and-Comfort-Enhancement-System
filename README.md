## Project Overview
In today's automotive landscape, ensuring vehicle safety and enhancing occupant comfort are paramount concerns. This project aims to address these concerns by implementing cutting-edge sensor technologies and advanced data processing algorithms.

## Features
1. *Fault Tracing of Wiring Harnesses:*
   - Sensors are used to detect faults in wiring harnesses (short circuits, open circuits).
   - Data processing algorithms analyze sensor data to pinpoint fault locations.
   - Fault alerts are displayed on the vehicle dashboard.

2. *Avoiding Median Accidents:*
   - Sensors and cameras detect invisible center medians to prevent accidents.
   - An audible warning system alerts the driver of potential hazards.

3. *Air Quality Monitoring and Improvement:*
   - Air quality sensors monitor pollutant levels in the vehicle cabin.
   - An air purification system integrated with the HVAC system improves cabin air quality.

## Technologies Used
